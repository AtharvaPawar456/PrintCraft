Certainly! Here's a template for the content you can include in your README file for the "PrintCraft: Online 3D Printer" project:

# PrintCraft: Online 3D Printer

PrintCraft is an online 3D printer application built using Flask, a Python web framework. This application allows users to upload images, convert them to grayscale, perform edge detection, and generate servo coordinates for 3D printing. The servo coordinates are calculated based on the edges detected in the image, enabling users to create physical 3D prints from their digital images.

## Features

- Upload an image: Users can upload images in popular formats such as PNG, JPG, JPEG, and GIF.
- Grayscale Conversion: Uploaded images are automatically converted to grayscale for processing.
- Edge Detection: Edge detection is applied to the grayscale image to identify prominent edges.
- Servo Coordinate Generation: Servo coordinates for 3D printing are generated based on the detected edges.
- Display Images: Uploaded images and processed grayscale images can be displayed.
- Display Servo Coordinates: Users can view the generated servo coordinates in a user-friendly format.
- Delete Files: Users can delete uploaded images and generated servo coordinate files.
- User-friendly Interface: The web application provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the 3D printing process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PrintCraft.git
   cd PrintCraft
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Basic pip cmds
    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Utils.py
    - cleanCods():
            Reads servo coordinates from a text file.
            Removes duplicate rows while keeping only 2 occurrences.
            Saves the filtered servo coordinates to a new text file.

    - DeleteAllFiles(testCodeFolder):
            Deletes all files in a specified folder.
            Lists files in the folder.
            Deletes each file, if it exists.

    - listFileinFolder(testCodeFolder):
            Lists all files in a specified folder.
            Creates a list of filenames.
            Returns the list of filenames.

    - display_all_content(file_name):
            Constructs the full file path based on servoCods.
            Attempts to open the file and read its content.
            If the file is not found, a default message is provided.
            Creates a dictionary containing the file name and its full content or a default message.

    - display_10percent_file_content(file_name):
            Constructs the full file path based on servoCods.
            Attempts to open the file and read its full content.
            Calculates 10% of the content length.
            Extracts the first 10% of the content.
            If the file is not found, a default message is provided.
            Creates a dictionary containing the file name and its 10% content or a default message.

## Usage

1. Upload an image: Choose an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, or GIF) and upload it to the application.
2. View Processed Images: View the uploaded image, grayscale image, and edges-detected image.
3. View Servo Coordinates: Explore the generated servo coordinates based on the edges of the image.
4. Delete Files: Remove uploaded images and generated servo coordinate files as needed.
